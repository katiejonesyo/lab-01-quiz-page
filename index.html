            <h2>
                ✨ Nicolas Cage ✨
            </h2>

            <content>
            <p>
               <center>The year was 1964 on a brisk January day in Laguna beach, a very interesting man born. His name? Nicolas Kim Cage. Nicolas grew into being a man of many facets. One of them being, acting. He took on many great roles, ESPECIALLY his role in Ghost Rider. Fantastic. His role in The Wicker Man? *chef’s kiss* The scene where he was getting attacked by the bees. Pure gold.

                During his acting career he had many other dreams and passions as well, such as buying a pyramid tomb, sleeping in Dracula’s Castle, and accidently buying a stolen dinosaur skull. He also decided to pursue a few new paths into metaphysics and naturopathic medicine. As an example, he bought the most haunted mansion in the world so he could write a horror novel and he took mushrooms with his cat. Nicolas described his experience with his cat as such, “I remember laying in my bed for hours and Lewis, my cat, was on the desk across from the bed for hours. Staring at each other, not moving but he would stare at me and I had no doubt that he was my brother.” Ground breaking. 

                Not only was he a common house hold name in the US, Japan loved him so much they even used his face on a popular corn snack called Deluxe Umaibou Nicolastick. He had no idea they did it, but they did! To his suprise he found this decilious snack on accident while on a trip.
                Poor Nicolas does seem to get himself into some crazy antics like previously listed. Another example would be being a victim of a massive comic book heist. As well as waking up to a naked home intruder eating a fudgsicle at the foot of his bed. 

                Over all, Nicolas Cage is an enigma and I am very glad he exsists. 
                Now that you have read a bit about this marvelous man are you ready to take the quiz? Lets see how well you know Nicolas Kim Cage.
